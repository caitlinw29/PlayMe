# PlayMe

PlayMe is a web-based application that allows users to randomly generate a fun activity idea or participate in a card game!

## User Story

```md
 As a bored individual, I want a fun activity to be generated at random, so that I can quickly find a way to pass the time. If Iâ€™d prefer to play a card game, I can do so in the app.
 ```

 PlayMe is a front-end web application. Our team designed and built this application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Materialize, and public APIs: [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/), [Web Search API](https://rapidapi.com/contextualwebsearch/api/web-search/) and [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/). 

```md
 GIVEN the PlayMe web application
 WHEN I load into the landing page
 THEN I am presented with a beautiful collage of fun pictures of activities, description about app, and cards with links to the activity generator and the card game
 WHEN I click on the activity generator card or card-game card
 THEN I am presented with a new page housing the generator or game
 WHEN I load into the generator page
 THEN I am presented with an activity generator that finds me a new activity at the click of a button
 WHEN I love an activity
 THEN I can save it to localStorage by clicking the save to favorites button on the card
 WHEN I load into the card game page
 THEN I am presented with a choice of number of players
 WHEN I add the player names
 THEN I can start playing a game of War
 WHEN I finish my game
